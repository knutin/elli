%% @doc: Elli example handler
%%
%% Your handler needs to implement two functions, handle/2 and
%% handle_event/3. For every request, Elli will call your handle
%% function with the request. When an event happens, like Elli
%% completed a request, there was a parsing error or your handler
%% threw an error, handle_event/3 is called.

    %% If you return any of the following HTTP headers, you can
    %% override the default behaviour of Elli:
    %%
    %%  * Connection: By default Elli will use keep-alive if the
    %%                protocol supports it, setting "close" will close
    %%                the connection immediately after Elli has sent
    %%                the response. If the client has already sent
    %%                pipelined requests, these will be discarded.
    %%
    %%  * Content-Length: By default Elli looks at the size of the
    %%                    body you returned to determine the
    %%                    Content-Length header. Explicitly including
    %%                    your own Content-Length (with the value as
    %%                    int, binary or list) allows you to return an
    %%                    empty body. Useful for implementing the "304
    %%                    Not Modified" response.

%% ELLI EVENT CALLBACKS

%% implementing a middleware, you can use it to spawn processes,
%% create ETS tables or start supervised processes in a supervisor
%% tree.
handle_event(elli_startup, [], _) -> ok;

%% request_complete fires *after* Elli has sent the response to the
%% client. Timings contains timestamps of events like when the
%% connection was accepted, when request parsing finished, when the
%% user callback returns, etc. This allows you to collect performance
%% statistics for monitoring your app.

                                _Timings], _) -> ok;

%% request_throw, request_error and request_exit events are sent if
%% the user callback code throws an exception, has an error or
%% exits. After triggering this event, a generated response is sent to
%% the user.
handle_event(request_throw, [_Request, _Exception, _Stacktrace], _) -> ok;
handle_event(request_error, [_Request, _Exception, _Stacktrace], _) -> ok;
handle_event(request_exit, [_Request, _Exception, _Stacktrace], _) -> ok;


%% chunk_complete fires when a chunked response is completely
%% sent. It's identical to the request_complete event, except instead
%% of the response body you get the atom "client" or "server"
%% depending on who closed the connection.
handle_event(chunk_complete, [_Request,

%% request_closed is sent if the client closes the connection when
%% Elli is waiting for the next request on a keep alive connection.
handle_event(request_closed, [], _) -> ok;

%% request_parse_error fires if the request is invalid and cannot be
%% parsed by erlang:decode_packet/3 or it contains a path Elli cannot
%% parse or does not support.
handle_event(request_parse_error, [_], _) -> ok;

%% client_closed can be sent from multiple parts of the request
%% handling. It's sent when the client closes the connection or if for
%% any reason the socket is closed unexpectedly. The "Where" atom
%% tells you in which part of the request processing the closed socket
%% was detected: receiving_headers, receiving_body, before_response
handle_event(client_closed, [_Where], _) -> ok;

%% client_timeout can as with client_closed be sent from multiple
%% parts of the request handling. If Elli tries to receive data from
%% the client socket and does not receive anything within a timeout,
%% this event fires and the socket is closed.
handle_event(client_timeout, [_Where], _) -> ok;

%% bad_request is sent when Elli detects a request is not well
%% formatted or does not conform to the configured limits. Currently
%% the Reason variable can be any of the following: {too_many_headers,
%% Headers}, {body_size, ContentLength}
handle_event(bad_request, [_Reason], _) -> ok;
